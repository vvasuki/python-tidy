python-tidy
===========

Cleans up, regularizes, and reformats the text of Python scripts. Suitable for use with eclipse.  This tool does some common fixes without the coder having to go do it himself. It need not be complete - one can always fix things it cannot handle manually. Forked from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy .
